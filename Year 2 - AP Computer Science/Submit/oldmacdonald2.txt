For fun, try replacing your main method with the following code:

BasicWordle program = new BasicWordle("oldmacdonald.txt");
program.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter()
             {
                   public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e)
                   {
                        System.exit(0);
                   }
             }
        );

BasicWordle program2 = new BasicWordle("oldmacdonald2.txt");  //you will need to make another text file
program2.setLocation(600,100);
program2.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter()
             {
                   public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e)
                   {
                         System.exit(0);
                   }
             }
        );
